# DeepSpeech Server

This is an http server that can be used to test the mozilla DeepSpeech project.
You need an environment with DeepSpeech and a model to run this server.

## Installation

    python setup.py install

## Starting the server

    deepspeech-server --model [model file] --alphabet [alphabet file]

where [model file] is the protobuf model that was generated by deepspeech and
[alphabet file] is the alphabet dictionary. The dictionary file can be found in
the "data" directory of the DeepSpeech sources.

you may need to provide the path to the deepspeech library:

    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/.local/lib/ deepspeech-server --model [model file] --alphabet [alphabet file]

## Using the server

Inference on the model is done via http post requests. For example with the
following curl command:

     curl -X POST --data-binary @[myfile.wav] http://localhost:8000/stt
